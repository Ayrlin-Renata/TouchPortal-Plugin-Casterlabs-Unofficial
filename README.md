# TouchPortal-Plugin-Casterlabs-Unofficial
---
A plugin to make follows, subs, and raids trigger TP states. 

## Don't actually use this!
apperently it only works on test events and every websocket would trigger on all event calls for the real thing. 
go see my other project CaffeinePortal if I finish it for a like, reasonable version

## How to use
1. download
2. import
3. go grab your widget links and put the authorization and widget strings into the settings boxes on TP
4. ???
5. profit

### States
new follower/sub/raid states valid values: 
`New`
`Waiting`
flips to new on event trigger and then instantly flips back to waiting
